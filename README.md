# TheHive - Hyerakon - Server Translations

## Description

**TheHive - Hyerakon - Server Translations** is a **test mod** for DayZ, developed with the purpose of translating and validating **all custom content** used by the **"The Hive - Livonia"** server.

This mod is not intended for final player use but serves as a verification and testing environment for translations before their official integration.


## Mod Purpose

The main objectives of this mod are:

* To centralize all **custom content translations** for the server  
* To verify the correct functioning of:

  * Stringtable  
  * Item descriptions  
  * System messages  
  * Custom interfaces  
* To identify localization, formatting, or loading errors

Once **translation stability and correctness** are confirmed, the content of this mod will be **repacked** into the main mod:

> **TheHive - Hyerakon - Server Utilities**
